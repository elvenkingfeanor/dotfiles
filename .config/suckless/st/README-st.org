* Note:
1. I was having trouble selecting URLs on st (=< v0.9.2) with the [[https://st.suckless.org/patches/externalpipe/][externalpipe]] [[https://st.suckless.org/patches/externalpipe/st-externalpipe-0.8.5.diff][v0.8.5]] patch, hence the [[id:9d69f2ce-bc78-4c1c-b883-f5eb86287a1d][copyurl v0.8.5]] patch.
2. Removing [[https://st.suckless.org/patches/colorschemes/][colorschemes]] patch, in favor of individual theme diffs.
3. Removing [[https://st.suckless.org/patches/bold-is-not-bright/][bold-is-not-bright]], as all bright colors removed from [[id:a9ce9ca8-6e4f-432b-a79a-7bcefbf8209b][my own custom patch for the onedark colorscheme]]
