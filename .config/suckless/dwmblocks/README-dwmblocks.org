#+title: Readme for my Dwmblocks

This is torrinfail's build of [[https://github.com/torrinfail/dwmblocks][dwmblocks]], patched with:
1. [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscmd/][statuscmd]]'s dwmblocks patch.

** Note:
Both torrinfail's dwmblocks and this patch fails to build with the following error:

*** The above error was in functions =termhandler= and =chldhandler=
*** The above error was solved by declaring those functions with =int signum=:
