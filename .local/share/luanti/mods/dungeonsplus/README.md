Dungeons Plus
=============

Add interesting features to discover in your world's dungeons with Dungeons Plus! Simply install this mod and your otherwise empty dungeons will instead be well-lit and filled with a dazzling array of features:

- Alchemy Lab
- Storeroom
- Forge
- Garden
- Jail
- Library
- Pool

Supported Mods
--------------

Dungeons Plus only supports Minetest Game and its derivatives (Asuna, MeseCraft, et. al.). It also supports a handful of secondary mods that can add to the items that you find in your dungeons:

- [Filled Bottles](https://content.luanti.org/packages/EmptyStar/bottles/)
- [Too Many Stones](https://content.luanti.org/packages/JoeEnderman/too_many_stones/)
- [Bonemeal](https://content.luanti.org/packages/TenPlus1/bonemeal/)

Caveats
-------

- Dungeons Plus does not add dungeons to your world; it only decorates dungeons that would otherwise be empty
- Only dungeons that are generated after this mod is installed will be decorated; existing dungeons in existing worlds will remain as they were at the time they were generated
