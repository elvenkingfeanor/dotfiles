# You *really want* a shulker box in Minetest Game, right?

Here is the basket mod, the shulker box for Minetest Game! It is made of fine wood, uses only one inventory slot to store all the items, and can be obtained quickly after joining a new survival world! All you need is a couple of wood planks and one string.

## ⚠️ Breaking changes in version 2.0

This version introduces a stable API. Check `docs/api.md` for more details.

The API have been redesigned and is therefore imcompactible with older versions of mods depending on basket, such as [Basket Cooking](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Emojiminetest/basket_cooking/) and [Refill](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Emojiminetest/refill/). Make sure to upgrade all those mods alongside this mod.

There are no changes on metadata; it is safe to downgrade as long as all depending mods are downgraded.
