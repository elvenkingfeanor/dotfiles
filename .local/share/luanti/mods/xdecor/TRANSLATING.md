# Translating X-Decor-libre

This mod wants to be translated in many languages.

The translations are provided in the gettext PO format (supported since
Luanti 5.10.0); they can be edited with programs like Poedit.

Many strings are commented, so read the comments to understand the context
of each string.

There are two files to translate:

* `xdecor.pot`: Main translation file
* `_xdecor_cut_nodes.pot`: Descriptions of nodes that were cut by the workbench

To create a complete translation, you need to have:

* `xdecor.<CODE>.po`
* `_xdecor_cut_nodes.<CODE>.po`

where `<CODE>` is the language code like `de` for German.

## Special symbols

The strings may contain some symbols with special meaning:

`@1`, `@2`, `@3`, etc. are placeholders, they will be replaced with some other
text. The translation *MUST* include all placeholders of the original string,
but you can change the order as you wish.

`@n` represents a new line.

Refer to `lua_api.md` of the Luanti documentation for more information about
the translation system.
