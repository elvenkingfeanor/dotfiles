Based on the Scythes & Sickles mod by TestificateMods, this mod adds various tools to make farming more convenient.

Scythes allow you to quickly sweep through your fields. They can only break fully grown crops and harvest multiple plants at once. They also replant harvested crops automatically. Alternatively, they can be used as an effective weapon with higher range.
Sickles allow you to scrape grass and moss from overgrown nodes. The resulting moss can then be used as dye or fertilizer. They also let you to cut wheat and other grains more precisely, allowing you to harvest some crops without completely resetting them.
Finally, rakes allow you to turn dirt into soil in a 3x3 area, so that you can create bigger farms more quickly.
