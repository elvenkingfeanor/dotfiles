#Use this file to specify research requirements for items, given specific names or groups.
#An item name will always take precedence over a group name.
#Group names may not always apply as you'd expect, if a modder added that item to the "rnd_goal" group in their code. 
#Specific item names will override rnd_goal.

#Give research requirements to items by first writing that item's internal name, followed by a space and a number.
#For groups, write "group:" followed by the group's internal name. Then follow that with a space and a number.
#The number you write is the exact amount of items needed to research in order to unlock duplication.
#It's okay to write the names of items from any other mods, even mods that aren't loaded.

#It's important to note that if no goal is defined at all, items default to their given stack size.
#For most items, this means the research requirement is 99. For tools, however, the requirement is 1.



#Some items, like slabs and stairs, have requirements based on how many you can get per block.
#This is especially so for slabs, which can be made back into solid blocks easily.
group:slab 198
group:stair 149

#A number of crafted items have a goal of 1 for the sake of convenience, since you only make one at a time.
#Plus, if you're making these, you'll almost always have the materials researched already.

#Some research requirements are based on how frequently you get items.
#Although there are massive differences between different ore rarities, obtaining them is still the same process, 
#via digging through through stone or wandering caves and hoping for the best.
#Therefore, these require less research than very readily available materials, with rarer materials being more difficult to research due to their power.
