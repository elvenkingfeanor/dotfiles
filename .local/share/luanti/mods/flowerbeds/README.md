# Flowerbeds
Flowerbeds are blocks that allow easier growing of flowers.
Once you place a flower on top of a flowerbed, it will quickly grow in nearby empty flowerbeds.

This growing is not limited by the usual restriction of flora density, so a single flower planted in a large flowerbed field will eventually fill the entire field with the flower.

In order to grow new flowers, flowerbeds must be on the same vertical height, and adjecent - even diagonally - to each other. Flowerbeds also do not work at all at depths of -50 or deeper.

Flowerbeds are crafted from 1 coal, 1 dirt and 1 wood placed vertically. Different woods yields different looking flowerbeds, but they all share the same functionality and can work with each other.
